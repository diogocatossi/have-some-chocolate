Enhancements:

* An optional regular expression builder for the Find and Replace commands. Select this on Configure » Preferences » Editor.
* A user interface to manage history lists. See the Configure menu.
* An option to display a Windows navigator when switching between documents with Ctrl+tab. Select this on Configure » Preferences » View.
* An option to use the Windows standard file open dialogs for users who require more functionality than is available from the themed ones. Select this on Configure » Preferences » File.

Issues resolved:

* When TextPad was not running and several files were opened at the same time from Windows Explorer, the first failed to open.
* The option to display tabs at the bottom of the window did not persist.
* The option to create new document tabs to the right of existing ones was not available.
* The docked Search Results window could obscure documents.
* Characters could not be input by typing their codes on the numeric keypad while the Alt key was pressed.
* The limit of 256 characters for file names in the open file dialog has been increased.
* Menus could temporarily disappear when using the Alt and down-arrow keys.
* The window background color in the dark theme could not be changed.
* The selected clip library was not reselected after a restart.
* See also version 8.16.0.
