    <releaseNotes>##TextPad 8.12.0 (14-May-2022)##

Enhancements:

* The Find Next in All Documents command now steps through all open documents.
* The syntax highlighter now recognises C++ binary literals, and Unicode and raw string literals.

Issues resolved:

* The Block Fill command didn't insert right aligned text correctly.
* Lines could be wrapped at seemingly random places.
* Repeat typing didn't allow for any white space that is automatically inserted after return is pressed.
* Repeat typing only worked with Unicode characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane.
* The EditUnicodeChar command only worked with Unicode characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane.
* Character code popup tips showed incorrect codes for surrogate pairs and they only worked on the left side of wide characters.
* The cursor position indicator now takes account of wide characters.
