    <description>SqlPackage.exe is a command-line utility that automates the following database development tasks:

* Version: Returns the build number of the SqlPackage application. Added in version 18.6.
* Extract: Creates a database snapshot (`.dacpac`) file from a live SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
* Publish: Incrementally updates a database schema to match the schema of a source `.dacpac` file. If the database does not exist on the server, the publish operation creates it. Otherwise, an existing database is updated.
* Export: Exports a live database - including database schema and user data - from SQL Server or Azure SQL Database to a BACPAC package (`.bacpac` file).
* Import: Imports the schema and table data from a BACPAC package into a new user database in an instance of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
* DeployReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that would be made by a publish action.
* DriftReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that have been made to a registered database since it was last registered.
* Script: Creates a Transact-SQL incremental update script that updates the schema of a target to match the schema of a source.

    <releaseNotes>### Features  

- Always Encrypted: Adds support for in-place encryption for Always Encrypted columns. Publish can now leverage a server-side secure enclave to encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt database columns in-place. This avoids the expense of moving the data outside of the database. See pre-requisites for in-place encryption in Configure column encryption in-place using Always Encrypted with secure enclaves. Note: In-place encryption is supported only with the offline approach.
- Azure Synapse Analytics: Adds support for column-level symmetric encryption
- Ledger: Adds supports for exporting and importing databases with ledger tables. The following limitations apply to Export: Ledger history tables and dropped ledger tables aren't migrated; the values of GENERATED ALWAYS columns and the data in ledger system views isn't migrated; the value of the database-level Ledger property is ignored.
- Platform: Adds support of .NET 6 as the target framework
- Platform: References Microsoft.Data.SqlClient (3.0) instead of System.Data.SqlClient in .NET Framework version. Upgrade Microsoft.Data.SqlClient from 2.1.3 to 3.0 for .NET Core version.
- Platform: Upgrades .NET Framework target version to .NET 4.6.2
- ScriptDOM: Adds support for Sql160 parser.

### Fixes

- Deployment: Fixes issue with interpretation of table distribution on column within a stored procedure.
- Deployment: Fixes issue with "Drop objects not in source" option during publish operation.
- Deployment: Fixes for Deploying a dacpac with temporal table having sensitivity classification.
- Deployment: Fixes a bug when variables are verified even when DoNotEvaluateSqlCmdVariables is set to true
- Extract: Fix for Refactor log of referenced dacpac according to includeCompositeObjects selection.
- Import: Fixes issue with importing database scope configurations that are not supported in target server
- SQL Project: Fixes issue where incremental statistics caused an issue with the project build when applied to a primary key.
- SQL Project: Fixes building a project with file tables.

### Known Issues

- Deployment: The Azure Synapse Analytics Workload Management feature (Workload Groups and Workload Classifiers) isn't yet supported.
- Deployment: The Azure SQL ledger table feature isn't yet supported for extract and publish.
