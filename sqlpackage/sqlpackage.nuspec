    <description>SqlPackage.exe is a command-line utility that automates the following database development tasks:

* Version: Returns the build number of the SqlPackage application. Added in version 18.6.
* Extract: Creates a database snapshot (`.dacpac`) file from a live SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
* Publish: Incrementally updates a database schema to match the schema of a source `.dacpac` file. If the database does not exist on the server, the publish operation creates it. Otherwise, an existing database is updated.
* Export: Exports a live database - including database schema and user data - from SQL Server or Azure SQL Database to a BACPAC package (`.bacpac` file).
* Import: Imports the schema and table data from a BACPAC package into a new user database in an instance of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
* DeployReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that would be made by a publish action.
* DriftReport: Creates an XML report of the changes that have been made to a registered database since it was last registered.
* Script: Creates a Transact-SQL incremental update script that updates the schema of a target to match the schema of a source.

    <releaseNotes>### Features  

- Deployment: Adds the ability for GenerateSmartDefaults property on publish to populate values from a default constraint when set to true. 
- Azure Synapse Analytics: Adds support for serverless SQL pools in Extract and Publish operations.
- SQL Server 2022: Adds support for ordered clustered columnstore indexes.

### Fixes

- Deployment: The Azure Synapse Analytics Workload Management feature (Workload Groups and Workload Classifiers) isn't yet supported.
- Deployment: Fixes an issue where publish to SQL on Linux would fail due to the default data and log paths being empty. GitHub issue
- Deployment: Fixes an issue where publishing an external table with file format changes would result in an error. GitHub issue
- Deployment: Fixes an issue where publish with a column encrypted with randomized encryption would not fail immediately if the column encryption key (CEK) was inaccessible, delaying the deployment error until the column encryption step.
- Refactor: Fixes an issue where a renamed column on a system versioned table would result in the system versioning being turned off and not turned back on. GitHub issue
- Platform: Fixes an issue where SqlPackage operations would fail on RHEL 9 due to an encryption error. Moves to use the 6.0.10 version of the .NET 6 runtime. GitHub issue
- Schema compare: Fixes an issue where the DoNotEvaluateSqlCmdVariables property for Publish and Script would result in the SqlCmd variables also not being evaluated on both the source and target instead of only the source.
- ScriptDOM: Fixes external table support for REJECT_SAMPLE_VALUE.
- ScriptDOM: Fixes an issue where compression options could not be applied to a table with a clustered index.
- SQL projects: Fixes an issue where valid options for the QueryStoreFlushInterval are incorrectly reported as invalid. Developer Community report

### Known Issues

- Deployment: The Azure Synapse Analytics Workload Management feature (Workload Groups and Workload Classifiers) isn't yet supported.
- ScriptDOM: Parsing a very large file can result in a stack overflow
